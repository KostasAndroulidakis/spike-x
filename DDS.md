## 6. Development Principles

### 6.1. Core Principles
*   **SRP (Single Responsibility Principle):** Each module, class, or function should have responsibility over a single part of the functionality.
*   **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid):** Prefer simple, straightforward solutions over complex ones.

### 6.2. Desired Qualities
*   **Clean Code:** Well-structured, readable, and maintainable code.
*   **Efficient Design:** Optimize for performance and resource utilization where critical.
*   **Concise Comments:** Explain *why*, not *what*, where code isn't self-explanatory.
*   **Modularity:** Design components to be loosely coupled and independently deployable/updatable where feasible.
*   **Testability:** Write code that is easy to test with automated unit and integration tests.
*   **Scalability:** Design with future growth in mind, particularly for data storage and training jobs.

### 6.3. Anti-Patterns to Avoid
*   **Dead Code:** Unused code should be removed.
*   **Duplicate Code:** Strive for DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).
*   **Hardcoded Logic/Values:** Use configuration files or environment variables for settings that might change.

---

## 7. Future Considerations
*   Advanced collaboration features (real-time co-editing, versioning of models).
*   Integration with experiment tracking platforms (e.g., MLflow, Weights & Biases).
*   Marketplace for user-contributed models and components.
*   Direct deployment pipelines for trained models.
*   Support for a wider range of neuromorphic hardware.
