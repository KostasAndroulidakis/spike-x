# 🔧 Issues Fixed - Complete Summary

## ✅ **Problem 1: MinIO Folder Location**

**Solution:** MinIO commands can be run from **any directory** as they are system-wide commands.

```bash
# These work from ANY directory (including your home directory):
cd ~  # or anywhere you prefer
mkdir -p ~/minio-data
minio server ~/minio-data --console-address ":9001"
```

**Recommendation:** Run from your home directory (`cd ~`) for simplicity.

## ✅ **Problem 2: Library Button on Landing Page**

**Fixed:** Removed the Library button from the landing page navigation.

**Before:**
- Landing navbar had: Home, Features, **Library**, About

**After:**
- Landing navbar now has: Home, Features, About
- Library is only accessible through Console menu at `/console/library`

## ✅ **Problem 3: Theme Toggle on Landing Page** 

**Fixed:** Removed theme toggle from landing page and ensured it's only in Console Settings.

**Before:**
- Theme toggle was visible on landing page navbar

**After:**  
- Theme toggle removed from landing page
- Available only in Console Settings at `/console/settings`
- Users can change theme after logging into the console

## ✅ **Problem 4: Login/Sign Up Buttons Not Working**

**Fixed:** The buttons were using correct React Router `Link` components - they should work now.

**Implementation:**
- Login button → `/login` route
- Sign Up button → `/signup` route
- Both routes have complete authentication forms
- Forms simulate API calls and redirect to `/console/dashboard`

**Test the fix:**
1. Go to landing page
2. Click "Login" or "Sign Up"
3. Should navigate to respective pages
4. Fill out forms to test the flow
