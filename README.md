# SPIKE-X

R&D platform for Spiking Neural Networks and Neuromorphic Computing

## Overview

- `lib`: written in C++, contains different models of neurons, synapses, axons, dendrites, architectures, learning methods, etc.
- `data`: contains various training datasets and various types of files.
- `backend`: written in C++, orchestrates model building, training workflows, and data handling.
- `frontend`: written in TypeScript, CSS (Remix, React, Theee.js etc), itâ€™s a user-friendly and interactive interface for building SNN models with real-time 3D visualization for architecture and track training progress.
- `api`: written in C++, it's used to connect `lib`, `data`, `backend` and `frontend` together so that they can all communicate with each other.

## Features

- Easily and quickly create, train, save, export and analyze SNN models.
- Modular design for rapid experimentation  with many different combinations of neurons, synapses, topology, etc.
- Configurable layers, wiring patterns, and learning rules.
- Integrated 2D/3D visualization to inspect network topologies in real time.
