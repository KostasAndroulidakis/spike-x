# spike-x
A research-driven platform for experimenting with Spiking Neural Networks.

## Overview
- **C++ Library**: Implements core neuron, synapse, axon, and dendrite models, along with multiple learning methods (e.g. STDP, BPTT).  
- **Python/Flask Backend**: Orchestrates model building, training workflows, and data handling.  
- **React + Three.js Frontend**: Provides an interactive interface to configure architectures, visualize 3D topologies, and track training progress.

## Features
- Modular design for rapid experimentation with different neuron/synapse models.  
- Configurable layers, wiring patterns, and learning rules.  
- Integrated 3D visualization to inspect network topologies in real time.
